#### Problem
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.  
Note:  
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

    Input: [2,2,3,2]
    Output: 3

Example 2:

    Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
    Output: 99

#### Data Structure
- Array

#### Algorithm/Method
- Bit Manipulation

#### Input
- `vector<int>& nums`

#### Output
- `int`

#### Boudary Checking
- `if (nums.empty()) return 0;`

#### Solution #1
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        int w = sizeof(int) * 8;
        vector<int> count(w);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < w; ++j) {
                count[j] += (nums[i] >> j) & 1;
                count[j] %= 3;
            }
        }
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < w; ++i) {
            result += (count[i] << i);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Notes
- Use Bit Manipulation. count[i] is the number of 1 in ith bit among all numbers.

#### Solution #2
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        int one = 0, two = 0, three = 0;
        for (auto i : nums) {
            two |= (one & i);
            one ^= i;
            three = ~ (one & two);
            one &= three;
            two &= three;
        }
        return one;
    }
};
```

#### Notes
- Use Bit Manipulation. one is till current number, the bit that the 1 appears once (after mod 3); two[i] is till current number, the bit that the 1 appears twice (after mod 3); Whenever both bits in one and two are 1, it means in this bit, the 1 appears three times, then clear it. Finally, the result is in one.

#### Time Complexity
- $O(n)$

#### Space Complexity
- $O(1)$
