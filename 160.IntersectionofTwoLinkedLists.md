#### Problem
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_statement.png)
begin to intersect at node c1.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
    Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
    Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
    Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
    Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
    Output: null
    Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Notes**:

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

#### Solution
``` C++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        if (headA == nullptr || headB == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        // get the tail of list A
        ListNode *tail = headA;
        while (tail->next != nullptr) {
            tail = tail->next;
        }
        
        // form a cycle on list B, and find the intersection
        tail->next = headB;
        ListNode *result = _listCycleII(headA);
        
        // break the cycle
        tail->next = nullptr;
        return result;
    }
    
private:
    ListNode *_listCycleII(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *slow = head;
        ListNode *fast = head->next;
        
        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == nullptr || fast->next == nullptr) {
                return nullptr;
            }
            
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        
        slow = head;
        fast = fast->next;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
};
```
