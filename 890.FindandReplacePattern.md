#### Problem
You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

    Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
    Output: ["mee","aqq"]
    Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
    "ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
    since a and b map to the same letter.

**Note**:

- 1 <= words.length <= 50
- 1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(
            vector<int> &candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> results;
        if (candidates.empty() || target <= 0) return results;
        vector<int> temp;
        _combination(candidates, target, 0, temp, results);
        return results;
    }
    
private:
    void _combination(vector<int> &candidates, int target, 
                      int index, vector<int> &temp, 
                      vector<vector<int>> &results) {
        if (target == 0) {
            results.push_back(temp);
            return;
        }
        if (target < 0) return;
        for (int i = index; i < candidates.size(); i++) {
            temp.push_back(candidates[i]);
            _combination(candidates, target - candidates[i], 
                         i, temp, results);
            temp.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```
