#### Problem
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

    Input: 4
    Output: 2

Example 2:

    Input: 8
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
                 the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x < 2) {
            return x;
        }
        
        int left = 1, right = x / 2, lastMid = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (x / mid == mid) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (x / mid > mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
                lastMid = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return lastMid;
    }
};
```
