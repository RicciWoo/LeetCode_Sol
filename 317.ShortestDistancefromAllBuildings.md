#### Problem
You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

- Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
- Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
- Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

Example:

    Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

    1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
    |   |   |   |   |
    0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
    |   |   |   |   |
    0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

    Output: 7 

    Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
                 the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
                 travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.

**Note**:

There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<vector<int>> &grid) {
        if (grid.empty() || grid[0].empty()) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        vector<int> houses, empties;
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    houses.push_back(i * n + j);
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    empties.push_back(i * n + j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        vector<vector<int>> dist(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> count(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int house : houses) {
            _bfs(grid, house, dist, count);
        }
        
        int minDist = INT_MAX;
        for (int empty : empties) {
            int x = empty / n, y = empty % n;
            if (count[x][y] != houses.size()) {
                continue;
            }
            minDist = min(minDist, dist[x][y]);
        }
        
        return minDist == INT_MAX ? -1 : minDist;
    }

    void _bfs(vector<vector<int>> &grid, int start, 
              vector<vector<int>> &dist, 
              vector<vector<int>> &count) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        queue<int> curr, next;
        curr.push(start);
        
        vector<int> dx{1, 0, -1, 0};
        vector<int> dy{0, 1, 0, -1};
        
        int steps = 0;
        while (!curr.empty()) {
            steps++;
            while (!curr.empty()) {
                int x = curr.front() / n;
                int y = curr.front() % n;
                curr.pop();
                for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                    int nx = x + dx[i], ny = y + dy[i];
                    if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (grid[nx][ny] != 0 || visited[nx][ny]) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    next.push(nx * n + ny);
                    visited[nx][ny] = true;
                    dist[nx][ny] += steps;
                    count[nx][ny]++;
                }
            }
            swap(curr, next);
        }
    }
