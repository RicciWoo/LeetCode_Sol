#### Problem
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

Example 1:

    Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    Output: tail connects to node index 1
    Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Example 2:

    Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
    Output: tail connects to node index 0
    Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Example 3:

    Input: head = [1], pos = -1
    Output: no cycle
    Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it without using extra space?

#### Solution
``` C++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (head == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        ListNode *slow = head;
        ListNode *fast = head->next;
        while (fast != slow) {
            if (fast == nullptr || fast->next == nullptr) {
                return nullptr;
            }
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        
        slow = head;
        fast = fast->next;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
};
```
