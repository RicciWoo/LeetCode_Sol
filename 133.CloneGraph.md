#### Problem
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.  
OJ's undirected graph serialization:  
Nodes are labeled uniquely.    
We use **#** as a separator for each node, and **,** as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.  
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.  
The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by **#**.

1. First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
2. Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
3. Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/

#### Data Structure
- Graph

#### Algorithm/Method
- Depth-first Search, Breadth-first Search

#### Input
- `UndirectedGraphNode *node`

#### Output
- `UndirectedGraphNode *`

#### Boudary Checking
- `if (node == NULL) return NULL;`

#### Time Complexity
- $O(n)$

#### Space Complexity
- $O(n)$

#### Solution #1
``` C++
/**
 * Definition for undirected graph.
 * struct UndirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     vector<UndirectedGraphNode *> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) : label(x) {};
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    UndirectedGraphNode *cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode *node) {
        if (node == NULL) return NULL;
        unordered_map<UndirectedGraphNode *, 
                      UndirectedGraphNode *> copied;
        clone(node, copied);
        return copied[node];
    }
    
private:
    UndirectedGraphNode *clone(UndirectedGraphNode *node,
            unordered_map<UndirectedGraphNode *,
            UndirectedGraphNode *> &copied) {
        if (copied.find(node) != copied.end())
            return copied[node];
        UndirectedGraphNode *new_node = 
            new UndirectedGraphNode(node->label);
        copied[node] = new_node;
        for (auto nbr : node->neighbors)
            new_node->neighbors.push_back(clone(nbr, copied));
        return new_node;
    }
};
```

#### Notes
- Use Depth-first Search.

#### Solution #2
``` C++
/**
 * Definition for undirected graph.
 * struct UndirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     vector<UndirectedGraphNode *> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) : label(x) {};
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    UndirectedGraphNode *cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode *node) {
        if (node == NULL) return NULL;
        unordered_map<UndirectedGraphNode *, 
            UndirectedGraphNode *> copied;
        queue<UndirectedGraphNode *> q;
        q.push(node);
        copied[node] = new UndirectedGraphNode(node->label);
        while (!q.empty()) {
            UndirectedGraphNode *cur = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (auto nbr : cur->neighbors) {
                if (copied.find(nbr) == copied.end()) {
                    UndirectedGraphNode *new_node = 
                        new UndirectedGraphNode(nbr->label);
                    copied[nbr] = new_node;
                    copied[cur]->neighbors.push_back(
                        new_node);
                    q.push(nbr);
                } else {
                    copied[cur]->neighbors.push_back(
                        copied[nbr]);
                }
            }
        }
        return copied[node];
    }
};
```
