#### Problem
Given the head of a graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a label (int) and a list (List[UndirectedGraphNode]) of its neighbors. There is an edge between the given node and each of the nodes in its neighbors.

OJ's undirected graph serialization (so you can understand error output):
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
 
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

1. First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
2. Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
3. Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/

Note: The information about the tree serialization is only meant so that you can understand error output if you get a wrong answer. You don't need to understand the serialization to solve the problem.

#### Solution
``` C++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;
    Node() {}
    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    Node *cloneGraph(Node *node) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        Node *n1 = node;
        Node *n2 = new Node(n1->val);
        unordered_map<Node *, Node *> hashmap;
        hashmap[n1] = n2;
        queue<Node *> q;
        q.push(n1);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            n1 = q.front();
            q.pop();
            n2 = hashmap[n1];
            for (Node *nb1 : n1->neighbors) {
                if (hashmap.count(nb1)) {
                    n2->neighbors.push_back(hashmap[nb1]);
                } else {
                    Node *nb2 = new Node(nb1->val);
                    n2->neighbors.push_back(nb2);
                    hashmap[nb1] = nb2;
                    q.push(nb1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return hashmap[node];
    }
};
```
