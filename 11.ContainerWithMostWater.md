#### Problem
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note**: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:

    Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int> &height) {
        if (height.size() < 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
        int area = 0, result = INT_MIN;
        while (left < right) {
            area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
            result = max(result, area);
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Time Complexity
- $O(n)$
