#### Problem
Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

1. An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. 
2. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. 
3. ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
4. length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
5. 1 <= rects.length <= 100
6. pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
7. pick is called at most 10000 times.

Example 1:

    Input: 
    ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
    [[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
    Output: 
    [null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]

Example 2:

    Input: 
    ["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
    [[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
    Output: 
    [null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    Solution(vector<vector<int>> _rects) {
        if (_rects.empty()) {
            return;
        }
        rects = _rects;
        
        total = 0;
        for (vector<int> &rect : rects) {
            int x1 = rect[0], y1 = rect[1];
            int &x2 = rect[2], &y2 = rect[3];
            if (x1 > x2 || y1 > y2) {
                return;
            }
            x2 = x2 - x1 + 1;  // save the dimension
            y2 = y2 - y1 + 1;
            int area = x2 * y2;
            areas.push_back(total);
            total += area;
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> pick() {
        vector<int> result;
        if (areas.empty()) {
            return result;
        }
        int randNum = rand() % total;
        int index = _binarySearch(areas, randNum);
        if (index == -1) {
            return result;
        }
        int offset = randNum - areas[index];
        int xDim = rects[index][2];
        int x = rects[index][0] + offset % xDim;
        int y = rects[index][1] + offset / xDim;
        result = {x, y};
        return result;
    }
    
private:
    int total;
    vector<int> areas;
    vector<vector<int>> rects;
    
    int _binarySearch(vector<int> &areas, int target) {
        if (areas.empty()) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int start = 0, end = areas.size() - 1;
        while (start + 1 < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (areas[mid] <= target) {
                start = mid;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        
        if (areas[end] <= target) {
            return end;
        }
        return start;
    }
};
```
