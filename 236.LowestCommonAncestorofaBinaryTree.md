#### Problem
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

Example 1:

    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Note**:

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

#### Solution
``` C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode *lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode *root, 
                                   TreeNode *p, TreeNode *q) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        if (root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        
        TreeNode *left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode *right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        if (left != nullptr && right != nullptr) {
            return root;
        }
        if (left != nullptr) {
            return left;
        }
        if (right != nullptr) {
            return right;
        }
        
        return nullptr;
    }
};
```
