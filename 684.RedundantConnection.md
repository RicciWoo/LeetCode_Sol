#### Problem
In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

Example 1:

    Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
    Output: [2,3]
    Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
      1
     / \
    2 - 3

Example 2:

    Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
    Output: [1,4]
    Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
    5 - 1 - 2
        |   |
        4 - 3

**Note**:

The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(
                vector<vector<int>> &edges) {
        vector<int> result;
        if (edges.empty() || edges[0].empty()) {
            return result;
        }
        
        int n = edges.size();
        UnionFind *uf = new UnionFind(n);
        for (vector<int> &e : edges) {
            int father_u = uf->find(e[0]);
            int father_v = uf->find(e[1]);
            if (father_u == father_v) {
                result.push_back(e[0]);
                result.push_back(e[1]);
                return result;
            }
            uf->connect(father_u, father_v);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
private:
    struct UnionFind {
        vector<int> fathers;
        UnionFind(int n) {
            fathers = vector<int>(n + 1);
            for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
                fathers[i] = i;
            }
        }
        
        void connect(int father_u, int father_v) {
            fathers[father_u] = father_v;
        }

        int find(int x) {
            if (fathers[x] == x) {
                return x;
            }
            return fathers[x] = find(fathers[x]);
        }
    };
};
```
