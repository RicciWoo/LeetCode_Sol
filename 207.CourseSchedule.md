#### Problem
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

    Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
    Output: true
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
                 To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:

    Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
                 To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
                 also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

**Note**:

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, 
                   vector<pair<int, int>> &prerequisites) {
        if (numCourses <= 1 || prerequisites.empty()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
        vector<int> degree(numCourses, 0);
        for (pair<int, int> p : prerequisites) {
            graph[p.second].push_back(p.first);
            degree[p.first]++;
        }
        
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (degree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int n = q.front();
            q.pop();
            count++;
            for (int i : graph[n]) {
                degree[i]--;
                if (degree[i] == 0) {
                    q.push(i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count == numCourses;
    }
};
```
