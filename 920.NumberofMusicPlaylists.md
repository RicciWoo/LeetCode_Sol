#### Problem
Your music player contains N different songs and she wants to listen to L (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that:

- Every song is played at least once
A song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played
- Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

    Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].

Example 2:

    Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 0
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]

Example 3:

    Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists. [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2]

**Note**:

- 0 <= K < N <= L <= 100

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numMusicPlaylists(int N, int L, int K) {
        const long BASE = 1e9 + 7;
        
        vector<vector<long>> dp(L + 1, vector<long>(N + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= L; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= min(i, N); j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (N - (j - 1)) +
                            dp[i - 1][j] * max(j - K, 0)) % BASE;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[L][N];
    }
};
```
