#### Problem
We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

Example 1:

    Input: 
    bits = [1, 0, 0]
    Output: True
    Explanation: 
    The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.

Example 2:

    Input: 
    bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
    Output: False
    Explanation: 
    The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.

**Note**:

- 1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
- bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int> &bits) {
        if (bits.empty()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return _isOneBitChar(bits, 0);
    }
    
private:
    bool _isOneBitChar(vector<int> &bits, int index) {
        if (index >= bits.size()) {
            return false;
        }
        if (index == bits.size() - 1) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (bits[index] == 0) {
            return _isOneBitChar(bits, index + 1);
        }
        return _isOneBitChar(bits, index + 2);
    }
};
```
