#### Problem
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the canonical path.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period .. moves the directory up a level. For more information, see: Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix

Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash /, and there must be only a single slash / between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) must not end with a trailing /. Also, the canonical path must be the shortest string representing the absolute path.

 

Example 1:

    Input: "/home/"
    Output: "/home"
    Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

Example 2:

    Input: "/../"
    Output: "/"
    Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

Example 3:

    Input: "/home//foo/"
    Output: "/home/foo"
    Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

Example 4:

    Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
    Output: "/c"

Example 5:

    Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
    Output: "/c"

Example 6:

    Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
    Output: "/a/b/c"

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        if (path.empty()) {
            return path;
        }
        
        vector<string> dirs;
        for (auto i = path.begin(); i != path.end();) {
            i++;
            auto j = find(i, path.end(), '/');
            auto dir = string(i, j);
            if (!dir.empty() && dir != ".") {
                if (dir == "..") {
                    if (!dirs.empty()) {
                        dirs.pop_back();
                    }
                } else {
                    dirs.push_back(dir);
                }
            }
            i = j;
        }
        
        stringstream ss;
        if (dirs.empty()) {
            ss << "/";
        } else {
            for (auto dir : dirs) {
                ss << '/' << dir;
            }
        }
        
        return ss.str();
    }
};
```
