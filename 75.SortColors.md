#### Problem
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

    Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
    Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

**Follow up**:

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int> &nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) {
            return;
        }
        
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        int mid = 0;
        while (mid <= right) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                swap(nums[mid], nums[left]);
                left++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else {
                swap(nums[mid], nums[right]);
                right--;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
