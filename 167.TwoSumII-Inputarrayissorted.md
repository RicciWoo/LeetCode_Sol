#### Problem
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note**:

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

    Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(
            vector<int> &candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> results;
        if (candidates.empty() || target <= 0) return results;
        vector<int> temp;
        _combination(candidates, target, 0, temp, results);
        return results;
    }
    
private:
    void _combination(vector<int> &candidates, int target, 
                      int index, vector<int> &temp, 
                      vector<vector<int>> &results) {
        if (target == 0) {
            results.push_back(temp);
            return;
        }
        if (target < 0) return;
        for (int i = index; i < candidates.size(); i++) {
            temp.push_back(candidates[i]);
            _combination(candidates, target - candidates[i], 
                         i, temp, results);
            temp.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```
