#### Problem
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.  
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:

    Input: [1,0,2]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:

    Input: [1,2,2]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
                 The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

#### Data Structure
- Array

#### Algorithm/Method
- Greedy

#### Input
- `vector<int>& ratings`

#### Output
- `int`

#### Boudary Checking
- `if (ratings.empty()) return 0;`

#### Solution #1
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        if (ratings.empty()) return 0;
        int n = ratings.size();
        vector<int> increment(n);
        for (int i = 1, inc = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1])
                increment[i] = max(inc++, increment[i]);
            else
                inc = 1;
        }
        for (int i = n - 2, inc = 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1])
                increment[i] = max(inc++, increment[i]);
            else
                inc = 1;
        }
        return accumulate(&increment[0],
                          &increment[0] + n, n);
    }
};
```

#### Notes
- Use Greedy and iteration.

#### Solution #2
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        if (ratings.empty()) return 0;
        vector<int> f(ratings.size());
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ratings.size(); ++i) {
            sum += solve(ratings, f, i);
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
private:
    int solve(vector<int> &ratings, vector<int> &f, int i) {
        if (f[i] == 0) {
            f[i] = 1;
            if (i > 0 && ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1])
                f[i] = max(f[i], 
                           solve(ratings, f, i - 1) + 1);
            if (i < ratings.size() - 1 && 
                ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1])
                f[i] = max(f[i], 
                           solve(ratings, f, i + 1) + 1);
        }
        return f[i];
    }
};
```
