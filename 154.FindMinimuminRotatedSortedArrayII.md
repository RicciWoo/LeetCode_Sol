#### Tags

#### Problem
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:

    Input: [1,3,5]
    Output: 1

Example 2:

    Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
    Output: 0

**Note**:

- This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
- Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int> &nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int start = 0, end = nums.size() - 1;
        int target = nums[end];
        while (start < end && nums[start] == target) {
            start++;
        }
        while (start + 1 < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] <= target) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid;
            }
        }
        
        if (nums[start] <= target) {
            return nums[start];
        }
        return nums[end];
    }
};
```

#### Time Complexity
- O(log n)

#### Space Complexity
- O(1)
