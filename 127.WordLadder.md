#### Problem
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.

**Note**:

- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example 1:

    Input:
    beginWord = "hit",
    endWord = "cog",
    wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

    Output: 5

    Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
    return its length 5.

Example 2:

    Input:
    beginWord = "hit"
    endWord = "cog"
    wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

    Output: 0

    Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, 
                     vector<string>& wordList) {
        unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordList.begin(), 
                                      wordList.end());
        if (!wordSet.count(endWord)) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (beginWord == endWord) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        queue<string> curr, next;
        curr.push(beginWord);
        wordSet.erase(beginWord);
        int length = 2;
        
        while (!curr.empty()) {
            while (!curr.empty()) {
                string word = curr.front();
                curr.pop();
                for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
                    char oldChar = word[i];
                    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
                        if (c == oldChar) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        word[i] = c;
                        if (word == endWord) {
                            return length;
                        }
                        if (wordSet.count(word)) {
                            next.push(word);
                            wordSet.erase(word);
                        }
                    }
                    word[i] = oldChar;
                }
            }
            length++;
            swap(curr, next);
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
};
```
